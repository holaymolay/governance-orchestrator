# Todo

**AI-managed file — humans should not edit this directly.** Add tasks to `todo-inbox.md` or provide them via chat.

## Bugs
- [ ] Default canonical branch choice to `master` when prompted to choose between `main` and `master`.

## Decision Queue

## Workflow Governance
- [ ] Add a dedicated Housekeeping section to `todo-inbox.md`.
- [ ] Rename `ai_workflow_revisions` to `framework_revisions` for clarity across workflow docs and tooling.

## Current Focus
- [ ] Commit and push the current workspace state to origin (housekeeping request).
